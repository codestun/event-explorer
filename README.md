## Objective
The **Event Explorer** is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built using React, following a test-driven development (TDD) approach. This application utilizes the Google Calendar API to fetch and display upcoming events. The primary goal is to create a robust and feature-rich application that leverages serverless architecture and PWA capabilities.

## Context
Serverless and PWAs have become essential in modern web development. This project combines these concepts, offering benefits such as easy scalability, offline support, and cross-platform compatibility. TDD ensures high-quality code, while data visualization enhances the user experience. This project will set you apart as a web developer.

## The 5 Ws
1. **Who**: The Event Explorer is designed for users ranging from individuals to professionals and potential employers.
2. **What**: It's a progressive web app with offline capabilities and a serverless backend developed using TDD.
3. **When**: Users can access the app anytime to view upcoming events for a specific city, and your code is readily available on GitHub.
4. **Where**: The server is a serverless function hosted by a cloud provider (e.g., AWS), and the app is accessible online and offline, optimized for various devices.
5. **Why**: Serverless is the future of cloud infrastructure, PWAs offer superior user experience, TDD ensures code quality, and data visualization enhances your skills as a web developer.

## Project Requirements

### Key Features
- Filter Events by City.
- Show/Hide Event Details.
- Specify Number of Events.
- Use the App When Offline.
- Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen.
- Display Charts Visualizing Event Details.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to filter events by city so that I can easily find and view a list of events happening in a specific location.
- As a frequent traveler, I want to quickly switch between different cities to discover events in various locations.
- As a user, I want the ability to show or hide event details, allowing me to see more or less information about an event as needed.
- As someone with limited time, I want to quickly scan event summaries and decide which events to explore further.
- As a user, I would like to specify the number of events I want to view in the app, giving me control over the quantity of events displayed at once.
- As a user with varying interests, I want to adjust the number of events displayed to match my current preferences.

### Technical Requirements
- The app must be a React application.
- Develop the app using TDD.
- Utilize the Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow.
- Implement serverless functions (preferably AWS Lambda) for the authorization server.
- Host the app's code on GitHub.
- Ensure compatibility with modern browsers and IE11.
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Pass Lighthouse’s PWA checklist.
- Implement offline support with a service worker.
- Allow users to install the app on desktop and add it to their home screen on mobile.
- Deploy the app on GitHub Pages.
- Implement an alert system using an OOP approach.
- Incorporate data visualization.
- Achieve test coverage of at least 90%.
- Monitor the app using an online performance monitoring tool.

## Project Features & Scenarios

### Feature 1: Filter Events By City

**Scenario 1: When user hasn’t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.**
   - Given the user is on the event list page without specifying a city,
   - When the user opens the app,
   - Then the user should see a list of upcoming events from all cities.

**Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.**
   - Given the main page is open,
   - When the user starts typing in the city textbox,
   - Then the user should receive a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they’ve typed.

**Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.**
   - Given the user was typing a city name (e.g., "Berlin") in the city textbox and the list of suggested cities is showing,
   - When the user selects a city (e.g., "Berlin, Germany") from the list,
   - Then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., "Berlin, Germany"), and the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

### Feature 2: Show/Hide Event Details

**Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default.**
   - Given the user is viewing a list of events,
   - When the events are displayed initially,
   - Then each event element should be collapsed by default, showing limited details.

**Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see details.**
   - Given the user is viewing a list of events with collapsed event elements,
   - When the user clicks on an event to view its details,
   - Then the event details should expand, and the user can see more information about that event.

**Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide details.**
   - Given the user is viewing a list of events with expanded event details,
   - When the user clicks on an event again,
   - Then the event details should collapse, hiding the additional information.

### Feature 3: Specify Number of Events

**Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 events are shown by default.**
   - Given the user is on the event list page without specifying the number of events to display,
   - When the user opens the app,
   - Then the app should display a default of 32 events on the screen.

**Scenario 2: User can change the number of events displayed.**
   - Given the user is on the event list page,
   - When the user specifies a different number of events (e.g., 20 events) to display,
   - Then the app should load and display the specified number of events on the screen.

### Feature 4: Use the App When Offline

**Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection.**
   - Given the user has previously used the app while online and cached data is available,
   - When the user loses internet connectivity and opens the app,
   - Then the app should display cached data, allowing the user to access previously viewed event details and data.

**Scenario 2: Show error when user changes search settings (city, number of events).**
   - Given the user is using the app offline,
   - When the user attempts to change search settings, such as the city

 or the number of events to display,
   - Then the app should display an error message, indicating that these settings cannot be changed while offline.

### Feature 5: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen

**Scenario 1: User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen.**
   - Given the user is using the app,
   - When the user accesses the app's settings or options,
   - Then the user should find an option to add a shortcut to the home screen, allowing them to install the app on their device's home screen.

### Feature 6: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

**Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city.**
   - Given the user is viewing event details,
   - When the user accesses a chart section related to the number of upcoming events in each city,
   - Then the app should display a chart providing insights into the distribution of events across different cities.
